## Donation and Resources Management System
**Bukas Palad** is self-hosted Donation and Resources Management System designed to help relief/donation centers handle donations given by people and managing resources used to repackage, assign and transport donation packs to areas that need them. It allows for multiple team members to use it at the same time, and helps keep everybody updates by publishing all activity to an update stream.

## Free (as in Beer) and Open-Source
As an open-source web application, relief/donation centers are able to download the application, install it locally and use it with or without the internet.

## Technology
**Bukas Palad** relies on the amazing Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) for the front-end and the awesome Laravel PHP Framework (http://laravel.com) for the backend.
PHP/MySQL powers **Bukas Palad** since it makes it even more easier to install on any computer as opposed to other technologies (e.g. a person can create a portable version of the whole application, complete with XAMPP and the **Bukas Palad** code).

# Setting up Bukas Palad

    - **show_group_pin** - set this to **true** to show the pin on the home page
